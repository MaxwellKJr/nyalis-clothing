# [Nyali's Clothing][website]

### What is it?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is a react based website for a fictional Clothing Line, Nyali's Clothing. I tried my best to simplify it as possible and if you are familiar with components you will be able to find your way around easily.

It:

- Heavily uses Flexbox and CSS Grid
- No Bootstrap, Materialize or any other CSS Frameworks/Libraries were used

The initial plan was to connect it to a backend with Axios but it doesn't work unfortunately. Feel free to continue where I have stopped. Happy coding!
