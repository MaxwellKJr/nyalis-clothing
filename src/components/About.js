            <p>
              Here at <span className="highlight">Nyali's Clothing</span> we
              fight against things that affect most children in Africa and parts
              of Asia in anyway we see best.
            </p>

            <h1>How do we do this?</h1>
            <p>
              We do not need to have large amounts of money coming our way by
              over pricing our commodities, that is why we decided to create a
              platform for <span className="highlight">everyone</span> and
              <span className="highlight">anyone</span> to contribue the little
              they have.
            </p>
            <p>
              Help us in fighting for the child's rights and well-being by
              <span className="highlight">buying</span> and/or
              <span className="highlight">donating</span> from/to us.
